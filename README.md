# Allegro2 | v2.0.019
#Read Me

Allegro2 is a new version of "Allegro" that has been written from scratch, with beauty in mind. I believe that IPB 4 deserves some beautiful themes and that Allegro2 is one of them.
With high quality royalty free images for both personal and commercial use you will never have to worry about copyright when using Allegro2. Your website matters.
 
Different colours of Allegro2 will be available to download on Webflake soon.

Support is given on WebFlake through PMs. Please include a screenshot of any problems you are having, and show me your custom.css file on pastebin so I can see what's wrong! If you have made any custom changes, please do let me know when contacting me so I won't be looking for something that's not in the original theme. 


Allegro2 is designed by Franceska for WebFlake users.
